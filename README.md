# FakeRoblox

made this in about 3 days lol

this is a fake Roblox-style login page project, mainly for learning / trolling friends.  
do NOT use this for real phishing or stealing accounts.

## Setup

1. install dependencies

2. open `dcwebhook.js`  
replace the Discord webhook **ID and token** with your own

3. run the project (depends on your setup, usually one of these)
npm start / node index.js

## Notes

- `node_modules` is not included (too big)
- you must install dependencies yourself
- make sure your webhook is correct or nothing will work

## Don’t know how to run it?

google it or ask ChatGPT  
it might take a bit, but you’ll figure it out

## Disclaimer

this project is for educational / demonstration purposes only (or is it?!)
