# FakeRoblox

Made this in about 3 days lol

This is a fake Roblox-style login page project, mainly for learning / trolling friends.  
Do NOT use this for real phishing or stealing accounts ( if only you can run it >=) )

## Setup

1. Install dependencies

2. Open `dcwebhook.js`  
Replace the Discord webhook **ID and token** with your own

3. Run the project (depends on your setup, usually one of these)
npm start / node index.js

## Notes

- `node_modules` is not included (too big)
- You must install dependencies yourself
- Make sure your webhook is correct or nothing will work

## Don’t know how to run it?

Google it or ask ChatGPT  
It might take a bit, but you’ll figure it out

## Disclaimer

This project is for educational / demonstration purposes only (or is it?!)
