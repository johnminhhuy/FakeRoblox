# FakeRoblox

This project took me 3 days lol, you can use this to troll your friends (but remember to setup your own discord webhook)
The discord webhook id and token can be found in dcwebhook.js, just change it and you'll be fine!
And also install dependencies (as I can't upload node_modules here for you)
If you still don't know how to run this, just ask ChatGPT or Google (it'll take a while, but I'm sure it'll be worth it!)
Good luck!
